# ADDA-grid-plot-codes
Python codes for plotting scattering-matrix elements in mueller_scatgrid files computed using the ADDA code.

These example Python codes were developed for plotting the scattering matrix elements in the mueller_scatgrid files provided at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15040283. In the example codes, the s11 element can be plotted as a function of both the zenith and azimuth angles, and the diagonal, s12, and s34 elements (as relative to s11) are plotted only as a function of the zenith angle in the upper (zenith's) hemisphere restricted to the scattering plane. All plot examples display the results in incidence angles 0째, 20째, 40째, and 60째.
